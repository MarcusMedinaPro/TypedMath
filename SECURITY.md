## Security Best Practices

When using TypedMath in your projects:

### For Library Users
- ‚úÖ Keep dependencies updated (`dotnet list package --outdated`)
- ‚úÖ Use latest .NET 8 runtime with security patches
- ‚úÖ Follow secure coding practices in your implementations
- ‚úÖ Validate all user inputs before mathematical operations
- ‚úÖ Be aware of potential overflow/underflow in calculations

### For Contributors
- ‚úÖ Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- ‚úÖ Run security scans before submitting PRs
- ‚úÖ Follow the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines
- ‚úÖ Report suspicious code patterns during code review

## Known Security Considerations

### Mathematical Operations
- **Integer Overflow**: TypedMath performs standard .NET arithmetic operations which can overflow. Use checked contexts if overflow protection is required.
- **Division by Zero**: Methods like `DividedBy()` can throw `DivideByZeroException`. Validate divisors in your code.
- **Casting Precision Loss**: Type conversion methods may lose precision when casting between types (e.g., `double` to `int`).

### Array Operations
- **Index Out of Range**: Array methods assume valid array sizes. Validate inputs before use.
- **Performance**: Some array operations create new arrays. Be mindful of memory usage in performance-critical scenarios.
